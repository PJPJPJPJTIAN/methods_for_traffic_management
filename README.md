This study focuses on developing traffic management methodologies during the construction of critical infrastructure, employing multiple algorithms for an in-depth exploration of traffic assignment within Qinzhou city's road network. We primarily utilize the link-based Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the path-based Projected Gradient algorithm, and the bush-based Algorithm B. These are well-established methods in the field of traffic assignment and have broad applicability.

To facilitate understanding and verification of our findings, we provide comprehensive HTML documentation. These documents not only present the execution results of the algorithms but also allow readers to download and review them directly. For those with a deeper interest in traffic assignment problems or wishing to explore the performance of these algorithms further, the code snippets can be easily copied and executed on the Python platform.

Moreover, we propose a gradient descent heuristic algorithm to solve a two-stage model based on OD matrix correction using link flow data. In this process, the computation of partial derivatives is a crucial step. While existing literature offers several methods for deriving partial derivatives—such as matrix-based formulae and variational inequalities—we adopt a bush-based traffic assignment approach in this study. This method proves to be both efficient and accurate when dealing with complex traffic networks.

Similarly, detailed results for this model and algorithm are provided in the HTML documentation. Readers can download the documentation for further review or copy the code to conduct more in-depth studies and experiments within the Python environment.

Through the provision of these codes and documents, we aim to offer valuable references and insights for researchers and practitioners in the field, contributing to the advancement of traffic management methodologies.
